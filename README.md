# About

These are few scripts and tools that I wrote for my use. 

These may be useful for some so feel free to use or modify the scripts.
Also If there is any sort of issues in these scripts then do mention them.

- **unwee** : a tool which takes in list of shortened urls and gives the actual urls
- **gitdmp** : a simple tool which dumps all the versions of a file in the git directory
- **freq** : a very very simple tool which finds the frequency of characters
