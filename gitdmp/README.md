# gitdmp

A simple script to get all the versions and changes of a local git repo which comes in handy in some CTFs and forensic challenges
I made this script for one of the forensics challenges in **Hack The Box**.

Feel free to use and modify the script or suggest any issues or changes.

## Usage

```
usage: gitdmp [-h] [-v]

option:
-v : dumps all the file changes of files in the git repo.
-h : shows help menu
```
